My lifelong interest is in building new machine learning and artificial intelligence technology with teams of highly motivated people. I studied at [Delf University of Technology](http://www.tudelft.nl/en/), did my PhD at the [VUB AI Lab](https://ai.vub.ac.be). I then went to Jordan Pollack's [DEMO Lab](http://www.demo.cs.brandeis.edu) as a Fulbright Scholar.

I continued my work on machine learning research at Utrecht University, see [my earlier UU page](http://people.cs.uu.nl/dejong).

The impact of new technology is only realized when new ideas are turned into practice. In 2005 I therefore co-founded [Adapticon](https://web.archive.org/web/20151011073210/http://adapticon.com), one of the earliest Deep Learning startups.

Since 2012 I'm at [Quintiq](http://www.quintiq.com), first leading the team that developed Quintiq's Demand Planner which forms part of Quintiq's S&OP solution, and currently, as of 2016, as Head of Predictive Analytics Technology.
